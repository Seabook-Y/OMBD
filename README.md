## Requirements
* python 3.9.7
* pytorch 1.10.2
* Torchvision 0.11.3
## Data
* The processed mouse optic flow features and RGB features should be placed under data/PDMB. As the PDMB dataset is private, we cannot share it.
* Typical instances can be extracted by running 'scripts/generate-KF.py'.
## Training
* Train the model
```
python main.py
```
## Ethical Proof
All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (UK) and approved by the Queenâ€™s University Belfast Animal.
